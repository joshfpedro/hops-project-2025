**spk_0:** You know, some of those points can be Don't need, there's a need to be a lot of space given to it. Um, then the key thing is trying to find like some work that puts us in a theoretical context, um, and, uh, you know, what do we know from From, from theory, from well-known other examples, from multiple other host systems beyond plant diseases, um, that they show that like our results are consistent with Um, when we think about epidemic behavior from theory, and from, from practice, and from diverse systems, um, So I think that's that I think that's a um so you're repeating like A lot of the results, but then you're Trying to place it in a broader context and think about what it, what it means. Um, I think the other thing that's really key here is that early intervention. So we're changing the number of sprays that are made when disease is first detected, right? So if it's not detected in a given field, it's just defaulting to the baseline that, right, um. And so there's a, there is an important, I mean the The success of controlling the entire epidemic is, is actually quite sensitive um to Uh, what happens? Um, in that first month, in the early stages of the epidemic, and small changes and the relatively small changes in the number of sprays, number of interventions. Um, In those fields where disease is present. I mean this. Translates into quite large economic differences over the course of the epidemic, right, at the end of the final time period. So I think that's, I think that's a really important finding that I would um Um, Could be developed and try to place in a broader context.

**spk_1:** Yeah, and I would just add to Dave's comments. I, I completely agree, and what you're trying to do at the end of the day is also. Identifying your contributions in in in. With respect to the rest of the literature. So this, this discussion really helps you, this section helps you identify the unique contributions of this paper.

**spk_0:** That's a good, that that's a really good point. So on, on that, um, There is something quite unique about our data set here in that um Um, one, we have a disease that's highly dispersable, um, And that We have a It affects both yield and quality. And that the impact of those quality defects is sensitive to market conditions, like market demand conditions. Um, so that's a, it's a pretty complex scenario and pretty difficult to um to model, um, and we're able to do that. So that's another unique thing that, that in this paper is the richness of the data set that we can actually parameterize this with the um Like with the disease observations and then what we actually know what growers actually did with their sprays, right? Um, and we're modeling this both what happens in their field and then in other fields, so the, the community effect of disease management. But I think that Combining all of this is relatively rare, um, so I think we want to emphasize that as a contribution as well.

**spk_2:** Yeah, I think this complexity of the problem is something that we should definitely emphasize. Yeah, because we want to emphasize that here we are uh Uh, tackling a problem, uh, which has several facets. Like we are trying to see, uh, what's the epidemiological spread that is happening in the situation where there is this long-range dispersion as well as there is pesticides that has been used as is also being use of pesticides has also been considered as part of a model, but we are not stopping there. We are trying to see what is also the effect of this epidemiological spread. On the uh growers' profits. So we have several things at play here and we are trying to distinguish what are the effects of different cohriates at play on this uh profit of the growers. So that's the main challenge that is there in this paper that we are considering so many interconnected factors.

**spk_3:** Yeah, I mean that was the motivation for doing this extensive simulation study because there are so many factors. We wanted to see what happens in different combinations, etc. etc. so.

**spk_2:** Since this kind, yeah, exactly. And since these factors are all interconnected, uh, that's why the simulation becomes so important because we are doing simulations one factor by one factor so that their effects are easy to see. That's what we are describing here.

**spk_4:** And like is there like a certain flow to the, like the results I can see there's a flow to the discussion like we're just interpreting the heat map, um, like the discussion it seems like every paragraph is like um. I don't know what to put first part, like, do I just like write in paragraphs and just have them in any order possible as long as I write something down, or is there like a flow to the discussion?

**spk_0:** Just like art, Joshua, like uh I need to find art um. Yeah. I, I think there's a couple ways to do this. Um, I I'll I'll give you like one approach, not that there's there's more than one here. There's there's not a single right answer to your question necessarily, um, but I tend to start by The first paragraph is Like a summary and uh emphasizing of the main points that will be made later in the discussion. Then I take Those those main points that are made in the uh like the first paragraph or so, those each of those, let's say 3 or 4 points that were emphas like pointing the reader towards. Use the next Couple pages to To flush out each of those points you made the first paragraph, um, And then at the end, I tend to like talk about limitations of like the data or the approach, um, anticipate where critiques might come and um Acknowledge like acknowledge those, but, you know, try to explain why that they um There may or may not be important or the limitations of for interpretation of the data, and then I try to end with a like a concluding paragraph that again places things in a broader context, um. You know, the contributions of the work, the, you know, for the specific motivating system, or more, more broadly for for similar um Your problems and modeling, um. That's, that's my general fly. I actually what I find really useful here is if you could find Just from other papers and just if you read a few discussion sections, probably from this specific journal, I think you'll get a sense for the Um, flow, um. And if you find someone that you think is a good author, read several of their papers and you can see some patterns emerging and how they they structure their discussion sections.

**spk_4:** Yeah, and also what I'm about to write, how is it different from what's already there and And um Like how would I improve and what's already there. Or should I just scrap this and just start from scratch? OK.

**spk_0:** um. So, I, let's see, I always recycle things where possible when it comes to writing, so I wouldn't scrap it necessarily, um. But I would Some some of this was written with other results, right, so this is incomplete. This is only like a working. Um, it's a working draft and it's incomplete. So I would, I think I would save it and see what areas you think are helpful and which ones need to be expanded on. I, I think you can probably recycle most of it, but this was written with earlier results, so some of the, the statements are not actually consistent with the most. With with the results of the present paper. Um, so one, that'd be the easy thing, updating those and then 2, just Thinking about Where there's holes and what needs to be expanded, um. But Since you have a framework there, I would, I would build on that.

**spk_4:** OK. And also, um, something I also I wanted to show you, um, I, I was planing with this, um, graphical visualization of the paper, um. it was just pretty cool. Uh, it shows like different keywords that talked about different um Things in the paper just kind of help to understand it. That was just a fun way to explore the different topics that we were looking at. Yeah. Um, But yeah, like, uh, I guess I just gotta keep reading and and and start writing and editing these things. It's just a little bit different from what I'm used to.

**spk_0:** Sure, writing is hard, it's really hard, and particularly a discussion section, um. Um, I think my, my best advice is to just to read several other papers in the same target journal and then just start writing and don't worry about um Where it's gonna fit necessarily, like writing, usually the act of writing will um This helps Formalize your thinking and, and, and make some of the, the ideas more concrete, um.

**spk_4:** Mhm. Is there any like tables or graphs that I should include in the discussion?

**spk_3:** No, I don't

**spk_2:** think. No, usually no.

**spk_3:** Yeah. So The discussion for me is like, you know, uh, there are so many different aspects that you have. Gone through in the result section or you have observed that, but essentially what do you want the readers to, uh, you know, take home in some sense that what is the take home message? What is the summary of all these different experiments that you have done so in simple, simple part it can, it can have multiple directions, but in that case, you have to go over them one by one, but It's like, you know, we, at the end of the, some analysis and so on, so what's the Uh, combined, uh, information message in upshots or take home. From the, from the analysis. That's what it is mentioned and some. Things maybe for future work etc. that we do not uh covered. Those things would be. In present present in the discussion section according to me.

**spk_4:** OK, you know, some limitations and future work, all of this is in the discussion, I guess you would put future work at the bottom.

**spk_3:** Yeah, it's like, you know, think about the setup that you're discussing to your friend who doesn't know about the Research in detail, so, but you know it in and out, so you're sort of summarizing for them. And uh you know, and then of course that. So things will come that you we haven't covered all of it, but you know, for example, these are not covered here, but those are.

**spk_4:** I thought the summary was like I thought the summary was the abstract. Um, so you're saying the discussion is kind of like a summary, and how is it different from the abstract?

**spk_3:** No, no, abstract is something that you're just uh giving discussion is more like it's not the summary itself. It's like, uh, you know, what are the Observations that you found out from there and you are expanding a bit. You're not abstract is more precise. Uh, OK, very, very, you know, concise. OK. But, uh, discussion, you, we'll have some sort of rooms to expand on or you know, we get a certain thing from uh. In two different perspectives and so on, so.

**spk_4:** OK.

**spk_0:** Um, did you have another comment? Looks like you unmuted earlier.

**spk_1:** I know, sure shouldn't said exactly what I was gonna say about, you know, tells, you know, what would you say if you were telling someone that doesn't know about this work, right? You know, draw that out. And then, uh, in, in the discussion, you do have more time to kind of explore, and I would say you compare and contrast what other studies have done and that really brings out your unique contributions.

**spk_4:** I would probably say it's complex and took a while, like, but I don't think it was. I think I would say that in the discussion, right? Or would you?

**spk_0:** Yeah, I mean, the complexity of it is. It's a difficult problem, right? Like, um, I think that having some space, that's kind of where we started. That's, that's kind of the opening framing of the discussion right now, right? The opening paragraph talks about how multifaceted this problem is, and, um, that's one of the contributions of this work is that there's a lot of things that change, um. And uh So like even approaching that problem becomes pretty, pretty difficult. So if you go down to like the first paragraph of the discussion. The present discussion.

**spk_4:** Yeah, it talks about how challenging the model is. Yeah,

**spk_0:** basically, I mean it took a whole paragraph to say this is a problem, right? And and why it's complex and um Yeah. So that's kind of there and then you're like the other points expand on. You know, they, we have all these complexities, but here are the, the key drivers in this system, what would we expect to see in other systems? Why, you know, I think that there's some space given to the approach. Um, I think the approach taken is a contribution to, um. Um, just like, you could, somebody else, like if they had a related. Patho system where they had um You know, it, it gives a guide guide post or how you could do this for other systems. If you could have a, a census sample or at least extensive sampling, um. Over time, and you have, you can acquire, you can parameterize it with disease observations. Weather data and then information from the growers, right? Like, um, on knowledge of the system. So that, that actually becomes, the data collection becomes possible um for other researchers to do. And then we've like outlined, here's a methodological approach for handling this really complex data, um, multifaceted. um data set. So I think that's something else I would, I think draw out too because I do think it's a roadmap for someone else dealing with it, uh, aerial dispersed pathogen. Can cause damage in several ways and where there's a community-wide effect of disease um control. um.

**spk_4:** Yeah. Like me, I'll probably take something away from that.

**spk_0:** Sure, so like, I mean, um, right, so like. This is an extension of the the the Um, severity model in some, in some sense, trend, yeah. Yeah. OK, does that, does that help Joshua? Do you need um

**spk_4:** I just, I guess again my encouragement would be to um to do some reading and and writing and don't.

**spk_0:** Um, And then the group here will can help her find it, but

**spk_3:** yeah, so it will, the text that you write, it will not be the final version, so you don't have to worry too much. So they'll it will be defined by all of us. So you just write what you think, uh, you know, you'd want to talk to your friend about. Uh, uh, and then as Tom said that one of the main differences with the, with the abstract abstract is the size, but in the discussion section, you can bring in, bring over the topics that was known before because of some literature. Uh, and then in that context, how our results. Change that or modify that or reinforce that, whatever, depending on the context. So, you know, and then since there are so many different facets, you can go 11 by one. You can in one paragraph, you can address one facet. After the introduction, introductory paragraph where the complexity is just that it's already there, then you can go one by one and then then. Uh, you know, see what can you say about the findings. Uh, in presence of the existing literature and, uh, you know. The new findings. So you write down one text and it will be refined, so no, you don't have to worry.

**spk_4:** I mean, yeah, it's, it helps gives me ideas and stuff, but I don't like in terms of like um like the flow and the ordering and how do I link um

**spk_3:** you'll not be able to do uh at once the flow etc. it will be flaw with flaws at the beginning. Every one of us had that whenever we write something, the first draft will be with flaws, so it's expected, so. Uh, but it has to have all the uh necessary points. Everything dumped at one place like you know we're throwing at the wall and see what what sticks. And then, uh, once things stick, then we rearrange them. Uh, you know, organize them so that, you know, the flows are maintained. So flows are not the first thing that you should, uh, worry about. First, to write down what comes to mind covering all aspects and, you know, in this line that, you know, the rest of this literature, they have achieved something. We have done some experiments, we have achieved something.

**spk_4:** And the literature, um, I'm not really too familiar with all the literature.

**spk_2:** Yeah. Sure. That

**spk_3:** that that that's. Yeah, they can help there I think. Sure.

**spk_0:** I just, yeah, I think if you capture the concepts, I can probably plug in literature as

**spk_3:** needed.

**spk_0:** I, you know, so some of the points in here. I guess I wrote this a long time ago or parts of this, but um. It kind of gives you an idea of how, what I think is important, but 11 thing I think that's Like biologically, so besides like the modeling approach and like the com the The framework we've That we're using here, this um You know how sensitive the optimal, like the simulated optimal control is to the number of sprays to the the primary um like the initial probability disease. I think that's pretty important um because there's, it says, it suggests to me there's some sort of I don't know if it's phase transition is the right word, but there there is some sort of threshold where we, where you go from, there's no Like simulated optimum to a clear optimum when you get to a certain threshold of of initial infections. So I, I think that deserves some space. I think that's a pretty key biological insight, um, as very practical outcomes too, like thinking of of future interventions, but that means, I mean, so we're, we're, um. We varied, you know, the initial probability of disease, but there's There's interventions that can That reduced the initial probability of disease. Um, there's some cultural controls, it could be with host resistance, it could be, uh, other, other things, and so I think that also points towards, um, You know, like A policy or a an area-wide management approach, a key aspect of this is going to be reducing um the probability of initial infection. Um, So, yeah. Right, so the goal is, I mean, so we're thinking of this in the perspective of like what's You know, maximizing um profit, um, but Also, in The other part of this is that when initial probability of disease is quite low, it's also minimizing sprays, um. Because there it's not necessary to to to have. These quite, you know, intensive spray programs when the initial probability of disease is quite low. So I think I would, I think that that deserves some space um in the discussion. Yeah. So obviously this is some of this might be idiosyncratic to this particular system, but if this is a An example, we're, I mean, we're obviously motivated by our specific system, but that, you know, that the application to other diseases, um, you know, it's pretty, pretty clear, I think, and, and so this is. You know, the, um, idea of reducing primary inoculum for these diseases that have repeating cycles and are capable of long distance dispersal, um, is a key aspect of Reducing their economic impact and also reducing inputs, that is phrase. OK. Um, Yeah, so this is all a little bit general, but hopefully it's helpful.

**spk_4:** Yeah, it is, it is very helpful, um. I'm just, I, I made a note of all the ideas. I'll just write whatever I can and I'll get some feedback next time and hopefully hopefully we can do, I'll do better.

**spk_2:** Yeah.

**spk_1:** I always think this is one of the funnest parts of writing a document, because you're really unfolding and then covering what you've done. Um, and then, you know, Putting clarity to it. So I, you know, so this is I always thought. Maybe perhaps one of the hardest parts of the. Paper to write, but. But also the most satisfying.

**spk_2:** Yeah. You have done this works for For such a long amount of time. Now you are getting the chance to present like what, what you have achieved. Essentially, that's what you are trying to present here. That this is the new things that we found. These are the contributions that we are making.

**spk_0:** So yeah, so, um, If it'd be helpful, Joshua, feel free to just send me some bullet points this week, um, and I can give you some. Early input on those just to give you the confidence to launch into developing text around those ideas.

**spk_4:** Yeah, I can, I can do that. I'm usually good with raising ideas as bullet points.

**spk_2:** Yeah, yeah. OK.

**spk_0:** Anything, anything else for today?

**spk_4:** Um, no, that, uh, I guess this is, this is all for now. OK. Um, but yeah, like, um, if anyone wants to like view the paper and edit it, I have it on the GitHub, um, I added some of you. Oh, OK, yeah, I have most of your emails here. Oh yeah, that that's that's I think that's it for that's all I wanted to ask for today. OK.

**spk_0:** Um, anything else before we part for the week?

**spk_2:** No, I think Sounds good. OK. I have sent you some, some, uh, not really changed, but some comments you can say on the document for GM, but otherwise the vision network paper is good too. Thank you so much. Have a very sweet day.

**spk_4:** So this is the direct link to the paper. on GitHub, if you add as a collaborator, you can join and and edit.

**spk_2:** OK, great. Get inside the GitHub.

**spk_4:** You can edit directly from um from GitHub if you click edit file. So we don't have to rely on overli and overly sometimes it's a little bit slow. I'll convert it back to latex at the end.

**spk_2:** Yeah. Anyway, this is in late, so no problem. Yeah.

**spk_4:** it's easy to convert back to latex. Only the reference so it might take some time, but I can do it. Yeah, I think this is an easier format for me because um Because it's easy to like put all the figures and everything like all the code and everything is there, and then I can um just Synchronize it with with the mark down file. I also have the latex file there, if you know, in the same folder. So if you wanna like do it offline with with a latex editor, but I've been having a lot of problems compiling it, so I just decided to just use um Mark Du instead it's easier. Yeah, work smoother.

**spk_1:** Hey Joshua, what did you make that figure in? That's cool.

**spk_4:** Oh, like I was trying this um this new like It's called Infranous. It's like a new um Network thing And you can like kind of like, I haven't really like littering with it too much, but um you can like ask AI to like summarize it and stuff like that. It's it's an extension called Infra noticeas. Um, But I I find it to like summarize high level concepts quite easily and you can like link things and see what concepts apply to what concepts. Um, and also there's this lot of view I didn't show you yet, um. So you can also do like a a a mind map. And this is like a mind map of the entire paper. And you can like collapse things and expand it and just see like. Easily like see different levels of the paper easily. It helps me with organization when I'm reading something, so I thought this was a good format to use. This is how I, how I make my notes. Um, I, I usually use uh like graphs and stuff to have my notes and I find that I wanna find something easily like, like for example, um, show you an example. Like if I go to graph you for my notes, I can see like hops project and things that are related to hops project and different. Notes that I've made throughout the time. So I, I find this graph um very helpful, so I was just experimenting with all types of graphs and Things that you can do on on notes. Still early phases, but thought it would looked cool at least.

**spk_1:** Yeah, thanks.

**spk_0:** OK. All right, uh, well, thanks everyone, and Charmo just got the, your email. Thanks for the comments on the paper. So I, I, I mentioned this right before you got on, but we're aiming to submit in around June 1st.

**spk_2:** Good to me. Yeah, the paper is ready yet. Yeah. Yeah.

**spk_0:** Great. All right, well, thanks everyone, and see you next week.

**spk_3:** Yeah, so next week, uh, I may not be available for some, you know, I, I may or may not be, no, it's dicey for me. OK.

**spk_2:** OK.

**spk_4:** Yeah, and they will email you bullet points and we can keep in touch.

**spk_0:** OK. OK, thanks. Um, one more thing just while we got people here Shohindu and Sharma, I reached out to Sarah Pay Bridge at Cornell and um about just to follow up on that project and um I think some things have changed with that student and Uh, I think the timing might be off on like Sarah's end and with having the right person to be able to do that work. Um, so I, I, I said that we're still interested in the, in the future, but, um, I think it's on pause at at for now though,

**spk_2:** yeah. OK. OK. All right, thanks for following up. Yeah, yeah, that's. Yeah. All right. OK.

**spk_4:** Thanks everyone. Thanks for your time and send me the card, please. Mhm

**spk_2:** Bye bye. Yeah, see you.
